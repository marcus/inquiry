# Inquiry

A single-page application designed to guide users through Byron Katie's method of inquiry, followed by a "turnaround" exercise. The experience is seamless, quiet, and meditativeâ€”focused on introspection, not UI elements.

## Features

- Sequential guided inquiry process
- Persistent storage of past inquiries
- Minimalist, contemplative UI with generous whitespace
- Ability to copy inquiry to clipboard in Markdown format
- View and manage past inquiries
- AI guidance that provides insights on completed inquiries
- Smart linking of suggested follow-up beliefs for deeper inquiry

## Project Structure

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Database**: SQLite with Drizzle ORM

## App Flow

1. **Enter Belief**: Write down the belief you want to examine
2. **Guided Questions**: Answer each question sequentially
   - Is it true?
   - Can I absolutely know it's true?
   - How do I react when I believe that thought?
   - Who would I be without the thought?
3. **Turnarounds**: Write three turnarounds for the belief
4. **Summary**: Review your inquiry and save or copy as Markdown
5. **Inquiries Index**: View, revisit, or delete past inquiries

## AI Guidance Feature

The Inquiry app includes AI guidance for completed inquiries:

1. After completing an inquiry, view it and click the "Get Guidance" button
2. The app will send your inquiry to OpenAI's GPT-4o model
3. Responses are streamed in real-time and displayed as formatted markdown
4. The AI provides insights about your inquiry process and suggestions
5. Potential next beliefs are automatically converted to clickable links
6. Click any suggested belief to start a new inquiry with that belief pre-populated

This feature helps deepen your inquiry practice by providing thoughtful reflection and suggestions for further exploration.
