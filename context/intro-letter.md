A Letter from Marcus

I spent decades exploring self-help books, methods, and practices, trying to address a deeper dissatisfaction with life.
Sometimes there were boosts — more productivity, better moods — but the changes never lasted. They never touched the core.

By my mid-forties, I had grown tired of the whole cycle — especially anything that involved worksheets or filling out exercises.
Yet somehow, I ended up reading Byron Katie’s Loving What Is. At first, it felt confusing. It almost seemed too simple to be real.

Still, something about it stayed with me. Despite my doubts, I gave it a try.

It didn’t take long to realize that the process, called "The Work," simply works.
Something shifted — quietly, but unmistakably.

The Work cuts directly to the heart of things.
It showed me that my problems didn’t live in the world — they lived in my unquestioned thoughts.

There are no real problems. Only the ones we imagine.

Does that sound too good to be true?

I invite you to try it for yourself.
This site will guide you through the process: start by writing down a stressful thought or belief, then move through the questions at your own pace.

It takes some time and practice — but the rewards are real.
Not quick fixes, but a deep and lasting change in how you experience your life.

I hope this form of inquiry will be as transformative for you as it has been for me.

Come take a look. You’re closer than you think.

— Marcus
