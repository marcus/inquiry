Hi, I'm Marcus, I made this tool as a way to share something that has been life changing for me. I spent many years exploring ways to address my dissatisfaction with many aspects of life. Sometimes there would be small changes, but they never touched the core.

Eventualy I got tired of self-help, it seemed that there was nothing that would actually work. Yet somehow, I ended up reading Byron Katie’s book "Loving What Is". At first, it felt confusing. It almost seemed too simple to be real.

Still, something about it felt different. Despite my doubts, I gave it a try.

It didn’t take long to realize that the process, called "The Work," really works. Something shifted — quietly, but unmistakably.

The Work cuts directly to the heart of things. It shows clearly that problems don’t live in the world — they live in our unquestioned thoughts.

**There are no real problems. Only the ones we imagine.**

Does that sound too good to be true? Try it for yourself, this site will guide you through the process: start by writing down a stressful thought or belief, then move through the questions. There's guidance along the way.

It takes some time and practice, but the rewards are real.

I hope this form of inquiry will be as transformative for you as it has been for me.

— Marcus
