# Inquiry

A single-page application designed to guide users through Byron Katie's method of inquiry, followed by a "turnaround" exercise. The experience is seamless, quiet, and meditativeâ€”focused on introspection, not UI elements.

## App Flow

1. **Enter Belief**: Write down the belief you want to examine
2. **Guided Questions**: Answer each question sequentially
   - Is it true?
   - Can I absolutely know it's true?
   - How do I react when I believe that thought?
   - Who would I be without the thought?
3. **Turnarounds**: Write three turnarounds for the belief
4. **Summary**: Review your inquiry and save or copy as Markdown
5. **Inquiries Index**: View, revisit, or delete past inquiries
