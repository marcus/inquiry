A Letter from Marcus

For years, I tried self-help methods looking for real change.
Sometimes life felt better for a while — but the deep dissatisfaction never went away.

By my mid-forties, I was tired of trying.
Still, I found myself reading Byron Katie’s Loving What Is.

At first, it seemed confusing — too simple to work.
But something about it stayed with me. I gave it a try.

And something shifted.

The Work showed me that my problems weren’t "out there" — they lived in my thoughts.

There are no real problems. Only the ones we believe.

Skeptical? I was too.

This site will guide you through the process.
Start with a stressful thought. Follow the questions. See what you find.

It takes practice — but it’s real.

I hope it changes your life the way it changed mine.

— Marcus
